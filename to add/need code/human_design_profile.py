âœ¨ Human Design + Anima Promise â€” Version 1.1
---------------------------------------------------------------
This module models:
  â€¢ HumanDesignProfile â†’ A simplified Human Design system profile
  â€¢ HumanDesignReading â†’ Wraps a profile instance
  â€¢ AnimaPromise â†’ A "relational contract" for how Anima interacts

Changelog (v1.1):
  - Added detailed class/method docstrings
  - Added inline comments to explain purpose of attributes
  - Structured output for readability
